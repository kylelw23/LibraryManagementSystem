# LibraryManagementSystem
A window application that manages users' information of a library 

Requirements:
    Installing NetBeans IDE 8.2
    JDK 8u111 
    Oracle Java: 1.8.0_111
    Runtime: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 1.8.0_111-b14
    
    
   After installing NetBeans IDE 8.2, open the downloaded project in NetBeans and run 
   I hardcoded the filepath in my src file (AdminGUI, LibrarianGUI, MainClass, StudentGUI) as D:/LibraryManagementSystem/... to retrieve information of librarian, student and book
   The three file librarianAccounts, studentAccounts and book contain all information of user and book.
   If you downloaded this folder and specify it in other repository, I think filepath should be manually hardcoded in order to avoid FileNotFound Error and to manipulate information of librarian, student and book in src files as follow: AdminGUI, LibrarianGUI, MainClass, StudentGUI.
